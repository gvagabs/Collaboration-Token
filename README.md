# The Collaboration Token
### A Thought Experiment in Moral Infrastructure  
**Author:** Gabor Farkas (2025)  

---

### Overview  
*The Collaboration Token* explores whether cooperation, empathy, and trust — values traditionally considered intangible — can be made visible, measurable, and rewarding without being commodified.  

The project proposes an architecture where verified cooperation becomes a form of social capital. It builds on principles of mediation, systems design, and ethical technology to ask whether digital infrastructures can reinforce empathy instead of outrage.
